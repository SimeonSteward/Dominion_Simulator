# Dominion Simulator
This is a Dominion Simulator created for the classical deck-building game [Dominion](https://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Main_Page) by Donald X. Vaccarino.
This simulator runs thousands of games of dominion between two different strategies and returns to the user the percentage one strategy wins over the other.
Inspired by Geronimoo's Dominion Simulator
